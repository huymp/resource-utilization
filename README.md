- `resource-utilization/raw-data` has the .csv files that are used for training

- `resource-utilization/src` has the code for training

- `resource-utilization/notebook` has the python notebook which contains the training code and the output of a full execution

To perform a train:
1. Create a directory in Google Drive and name it `secure-cloud-computation`

2. Upload all the .csv files in `raw-data` to that directory

3. Upload `notebook/secure_cloud_computation_finals_project.ipynb` to Google Colab

4. Execute the notebook
